#### 4. Understand, plan, & implement the Robot Sort algorithm _(6 points)_

You have been given a robot with very basic capabilities:

- It can move left or right.
- It can pick up an item
- If it tries to pick up an item while already holding one, it will swap the items instead.
- It can compare the item it's holding to the item in front of it.
- It can switch a light on its head on or off.

Your task is to program this robot to sort lists using ONLY these abilities.

##### Rules

Inside the `robot_sort` directory you'll find the `robot_sort.py` file. Open it up and read through each of the robot's abilities. Once you've understood those, start filling out the `sort()` method following these rules:

- You may use any pre-defined robot methods.
- You may NOT modify any pre-defined robot methods.
- You may use logical operators. (`if`, `and`, `or`, `not`, etc.)
- You may use comparison operators. (`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`, `is`, etc.)
- You may use iterators. (`while`, `for`, `break`, `continue`)
- You may NOT store any variables. (`=`)
- You may NOT access any instance variables directly. (`self._anything`)
- You may NOT use any Python libraries or class methods. (`sorted()`, etc.)
- You may define robot helper methods, as long as they follow all the rules.

##### Hints

- Make sure you understand the problem and all of the rules! A solution that breaks the rules will not receive full credit.

- If you're unsure if an operator or method is allowed, ask.

- Lay out some numbered cards in a line and try sorting them as if you were the robot.

- Come up with a plan and write out your algorithm before coding. If your plan is sound but you don't reach a working implementation in three hours, you may receive partial credit.

- There is no efficiency requirement but you may lose points for an unreasonably slow solution. Tests should run in far less than 1 second.

- We discussed a sorting method this week that might be useful. Which one?

- The robot has exactly one bit of memory: its light. Why is this important?

Run `python test_robot.py` to run the tests for your `robot_sort()` function to ensure that your implementation is correct.

"""
Plan:
Turn on Robot
Starting sorting from the left to right (starting at the index 0 moving right!)
will need to swap item 
start at second item, compare (first 2 items) current item to the next item
compare if held item is greater or less, if greater move to the right (or keep in current location) of the less card
then move on to the next two items
if any swaps ar made, robot will need to go through the items again


running out of time (sigh)

Last step will be to turn off Robot when everything is sorted
